# Cryptocurrencies
# Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide a report to an investment bank. This bank will use your infomation in order to consider launching a new bitcoin investment portfolio. This report provides details to show cryptocurrencies are available for purchase. The report also tries to depict how each crytocurrency is classified. This will then be used to develop a categorization system for this new investment. 

# Results
The process begins cleaning up the data to include only active trading cryptocurrencies with a specified algorithm and a comprehensive set of data. Once this was completed I am able to show that there are 532 distinct cryptocurrencies. I then wsa able to place this data into a three-dimensional graph to demonstrate how the various cryptocurrencies are organized. Each point has a name as well as the algorithm that was used to produce it.

Next, I create a two-dimensional graph to demonstrate the link between total coin supply and total coins mined. The purpose of creating this is to show the coorealation between one currency against the others.
